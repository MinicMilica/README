## About The Project
This application was created for easier passenger records. With it we can create, delete and update profiles. Profiles contain basic information about the passenger:
* First and last name
* Passport ID
* Email address
Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!
